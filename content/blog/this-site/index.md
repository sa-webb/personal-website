This site is written in TypeScript and built with [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/), [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/), [Particles.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/), and is deployed on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

If you're a web developer or someone interested in technology - then hopefully you've heard of [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) if not, it is time!

 I enourage you to read my tutorial [Intro-to-Gatsby.js](https://sa-webb/blog/intro-to-gatsby).

First and foremost - I have a lot of experience with frontend development, especially with React. Incase you did not read my Intro-to-Gatsby article or are unfamiliar with Gatsby, then here is it's formal description. 

"Gatsby is a React-based open source framework for creating websites and apps.[1]" https://www.gatsbyjs.com/
