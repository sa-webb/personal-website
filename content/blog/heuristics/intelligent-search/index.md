Artifical Intelligence is structured using Neural Networks "which loosely model the neurons in a biologcal brain." [1]

In this article, we explore ideas from multiple branches of science that aggregate into a  polymorphic theory of learning that can act as guide when learning something new to general problem solving.

This article is dedicated to
